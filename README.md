Creating a calculator was a task during NAVTTC MERN Stack course at GameTrain, Frage Games Lahore.
This calculator is created by using html, css and js capable to perform basics maths operations like ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE.
Calculations have been done without using js built-in eval() function.
